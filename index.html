<!--PROJECT OVERVIEW-->
<h3>Project Overview</h3>

    <h4>TL;DR</h4>


    <p>Half of Americans follow specific diets, yet the Starbucks app lacks features to support dietary preferences. Our solution allows users to set their preferences, providing tailored recommendations throughout the menu and making customization easier and more intuitive.
    </p>
    </section>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>According to a 2023 study by the International Food Information Council, <b>5 out of 10</b> Americans follow a specific eating pattern or diet.
        <br>
        For many, maintaining these dietary preferences comes with <b>daily challenges</b>—whether it’s grocery shopping, dining out, or grabbing their daily caffeine fix.</p>

    <p>The Starbucks app, consistently ranked among the top 10 Food and Drink apps on the App Store, is celebrated for its convenience, especially when it comes to ordering customized drinks ahead of time.</p>

    <p>However, despite offering extensive customization options, the app provides <b>little guidance</b> and <b>lacks features</b> to set or save <b>dietary preferences.</b></p>


    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>We addressed dietary uncertainty with a Taste Preferences Setting, a personalized 'For You' menu, and enhanced product pages with dietary conflict warnings, creating a more tailored and confident ordering experience.</p>

    <h4>Impact</h4>

    <p>Our solution empowers users to make confident, informed choices by aligning their dietary needs with tailored recommendations. This enhances user satisfaction, reduces decision fatigue, and positions Starbucks as a more inclusive and customer-focused brand.</p>

    <p>With nearly 40,000 locations worldwide, Starbucks remains as the #1
    coffee chain in the world.
    <br>
    Renowned for its premium coffee, handcrafted beverages, and personalized service, it boasts a loyal customer base and a consistent global presence. 
    <br>
    Customers choose Starbucks for its high-quality, customizable drinks and comfortable, convenient experience, and the app is a huge part of that for many Starbucks drinkers.
    <br>
    With an app that allows you to fine-tune every drink on their already large menu, we chose this app to explore the complexities users face in the customization process

                    <p>Finding: 5/6 users thought that clicking “See all” would allow them to see all the drinks in that category, even though it meant all the drinks in that category in the submenu.</p>
